# ðŸ’« About My EDA Project:
Hi, I'm, RudraNarayana Samal,this is my Exploratory Data analysis  using Python.

An EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project is all about understanding the datasetâ€”finding patterns, spotting anomalies, testing assumptions, and checking relationships between variablesâ€”before you dive into building models or making predictions.
 
#### 1. I use the Excel dataset. (usually CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
As the Data set is more than 125MB I could not load it here.

#### 2. Data Exploration
- Number of rows/columns
- Finding Data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)
- Sample values (df.head() in pandas)

#### 3. Data Validation
- Finding and replacing missing values and errors
- Outliers detection and validation
- Identifying and manupulating the categorical, discret and countineous variabls
- Finding relation between variables and target
- Fetching interdependency between the variables

#### 4. Univariate Analysis
- Analyze individual features (one at a time):
- For categorical: bar plots, value counts
- For numerical: histograms, box plots, summary stats (mean, std, min, max, etc.)

#### 5. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
- Analyze relationships between variables:
- Scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots
- Correlation matrix
- Grouped statistics (e.g., average revenue by region)
- Cross-tabulations (for categorical features)

#### 6. Feature Engineering
Create new features (e.g., age from date of birth)
Encode categorical variables
Normalize/scale numerical features if needed


#### 7. Key Insights & Visualizations
Highlight trends, patterns, and potential predictors
Use visuals (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) to make your analysis intuitive and compelling
